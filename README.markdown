FastForms
=========

FastForms, as the name implies, is a very fast way to generate forms for a TinyDb model. It's pluggable, skinnable,
and highly configurable, but also sets very sensible defaults and tries to do your work for you.

Integrating it in an existing application is easy - you can get some pretty nice forms in under 5 minutes.

FastForms works very well with CuteControllers, but you can use it with any routing system you want.
